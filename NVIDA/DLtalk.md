# Deep learning #

* quotes AI index report 

## frameworks ##

* Accelerated versions optimized for nvida gpus
* Notes that Keras and Pytorch are increasing
* Tensorflow still most popular
* NVIDA DIGITS black box style stystem downloadable from GitHub
  * Notes visulalizaing along the way
* Keras is to be integrated in Tensor Flow 2 (tensor flow backend already)
* Currently doesn' work well with multicore GPU due to comunication issues 
* Has python interface but still requires declaration etc everywhere
* Pytorch - more pythonic, works well with GPUs, user friendly, limitations with deployment - to be used with Kaffe. Has visdom option
* Caffe 2 also developed by facebook
* RAPIDS.ai free optimized versions
